# CourseTrackr
This application, developed in Flask, enables electronic signature of work-study students' sign-in sheets.
It retrieves the schedules from ADE, then asks the student to have the teacher sign them. At the end of the week, the student can generate a PDF with all the signatures.
An evolution was planned to allow teachers to sign with a space dedicated to them. 

**The project was abandoned due to the use of new methods in the organization of these sign-in sheets.**
